2. The user is granted the right to use the Software free of charge.
3. The computer program described in the user manual conforms to the latest technological standards. Hermann Seib (hereinafter called "Licensor") wishes to point out, however, that the latest technological standards do not guarantee software programs to function entirely without error in all applications and combinations.

1. The Licensee may install the Software on a private Personal Computer, load it into the user memory and run it accordingly.
2. The Licensee may only use the Software for strictly private purposes. Institutes of education and public utilities are classed as commercial or business premises. Similarly, the Software may not be used in a home office for commercial or business purposes.
3. The Licensee may copy the complete Software package in order to pass it on to a third party provided he/she does so free of charge, leaving the brand name, logo and copyright note intact and drawing attention to these conditions of use.

ß4 Distribution of rights

The copyright covers in particular the program code, documentation, appearance, structure and organisation of the program files, program name, logos and other forms of representation within the Software.
2. The Licensee is only granted the right to individual, private use of the Software. This does not imply conferral of any rights to the Software itself. The Licensor reserves all rights of publication, reproduction, editing and utilisation.


ß5 Term of agreement

1. The agreement is concluded for an indefinite period. The Licenseeís right to use the Software shall end automatically without notice in the event of non-compliance with any of the conditions of this agreement.
2. On termination of the right of use, the Licensee is obliged to uninstall the Software from his/her computer system. He/she is also obliged to destroy all copies of the Software together with all written material and all copies thereof, including any modified copies.


ß6 Warranty

1. The right to use this Software is granted to the Licensee free of charge. It is not therefore subject to any sales or warranty legislation. The Licensee must accept this program in its currently available form, and is consequently not entitled to any warranty claims.


ß7 Liability

1. The Licensor guarantees the fitness of the product for the contractual purpose, as described in the program specification and user manual. No liability is accepted in respect of the suitability of the Software for the userís purposes and its compatibility with the userís existing software.
2. Damage claims against Hermann Seib are excluded irrespective of legal basis, particularly on grounds of delayed performance or impossibility, neglect of advisory and accessory contractual obligations, pre-contractual duties, defective performance, violation of third-party industrial property rights and unlawful acts, unless Hermann Seib has acted with intent or gross negligence or unless the damage claims result from the failure to ensure a warranted quality.
3. Insofar as grounds for liability on the part of Hermann Seib exist, the damage claim shall be limited to the extent of the foreseeable damage. Compensation for consequential damage such as loss of profit is excluded in all cases. This damage limitation clause shall not apply if the event giving rise to the damage was caused with intent or gross negligence by one of its legal representatives or senior employees.
4. All damage claims against Hermann Seib shall expire by limitation six months after the receipt of the Software. This does not apply to claims based on unlawful acts.
5. These provisions do not apply to claims based on product liability legislation.


ß8 Damage minimisation obligation

1. The Licensee is explicitly reminded that he/she must make backups of the data on his computer at adequate, regular intervals (normally once a week). Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of the Licenseeís damage minimisation obligation, and Hermann Seib shall not be liable for any resultant damage.
2. The Licensee is explicitly reminded that he/she must not use the Software in hazardous environments in which non fault-tolerant operation is imperative (e.g. high-risk activities such as the operation of nuclear power installations, defence systems, air navigation or communication systems or life-support machines). Failure to observe this condition shall constitute a breach of the Licenseeís damage minimisation obligation, and Hermann Seib shall not be liable for any resultant damage.

1. These conditions of use apply in the currently applicable version as published in the website [www.hermannseib.com].

ß11 Final provisions

1. All supplements to this contract, including this clause, must be made in writing.
2. Should any provision of this agreement be or become invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect the legal validity of the other provisions. In this case, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced where possible by a legitimate provision with an equivalent commercial intent.
3. This agreement is subject to the law of the Republic of Austria. The place of jurisdiction shall be the domicile of the Licensor.
