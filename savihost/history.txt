SAVIHost Version History
========================

Before V1.42, SAVIHost's history could only be found on KvR (see 
  http://www.kvraudio.com/product/savihost-by-hermann-seib/news
for details); since I can't expect that everyone knows this, I'll keep track
of the changes here, too.
You can mentally add "Lots of bug fixes and internal changes" to each list of
changes; I won't explicitly state that each time :-)

V1.42
=====

Release Date: 2013-06-25
Changes:
- Fixed incompatibility with ReaJS and other PlugIns that don't pass back a
  chunk before one's been loaded
- VST3 MIDI Controller -> Parameter ID remapping didn't work correctly
- added soft clipping
- added VST Module Architecture distributions
  (presumably purely an intellectual exercise, no necessity)
- added PlugIn Editor window support for VST Module Architecture PlugIns.
  NB: this is limited to the few VSTMA PlugIns I could find on the 'net.
  If you got others which use additional features of Steinberg's over-the-top
  XML UI specification, please let me know.

V1.41
=====

Release Date: 2013-01-07
Changes:
- MIDI Transformations from VSTHost have been added.
- VST3-capable programs use VST SDK 3.5 instead of 3.1.

V1.40
=====

Release Date: 2011-09-20
Changes:
- Incoming MIDI SysEx messages killed the x64 versions.
- A bad "optimization" killed MME Wave Input device usage.

V1.39
=====

Release Date: 2011-08-04
Changes:
- SSE2 bug cured that caused ghastly noise when the output to a 24-bit sound
  card needed clipping.
- "Linear Knob mode" implemented.
- SAVIHost now contains a VST3.1 host in 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

V1.38
=====

Release Date: 2011-07-14
Changes:
- SAVIHost now comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

V1.37
=====

Release Date: 2011-04-04
Changes:
- Use of SSE(2) when possible and appropriate; doesn't make much difference
  in SAVIHost.

V1.36
=====

Release Date: 2010-11-29
Changes:
- Wave Player level and Recording level can be adjusted.
- 1st configured MIDI Input was not opened correctly upon program start -
  corrected.
- .fxb bank files are saved in version 2 format now; if this is not wanted,
  it can be changed by adding a DWORD setting in the registry:
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Seib\<PlugIn>\Settings\BankSaveVersion=1.

V1.35
=====

Release Date: 2010-11-01
Changes:
- just bug fixes

V1.34
=====

Release Date: 2009-11-26
Changes:
- Wave player supports auto-stereo mode for mono files.
- Can be minimized to system tray.

V1.33
=====

Release Date: 2009-10-15
Changes:
- Can play .mp3 files (using external mpg123 package - see VSTHost
  documentation for details).

V1.32
=====

Release Date: 2008-01-17
Changes:
- DirectSound support added (works in all Windows versions except Vista).
- Added /nomme, /nodsound, /noasio command line flags to suppress the use
  of the corresponding wave I/O method for special environments.
- Added /noft ("No Fault Tolerance") flag for debugging environments; in this
  mode, SAVIHost doesn't catch any exception, which eases the detection of
  badly behaving PlugIns.

V1.31
=====

Release Date: 2007-07-19
Changes:
- Improved exception handling (a classic "Who cares?" under normal conditions).
- "Autosave Bank" built in; SAVIHost can save the current bank to
  PlugInName.savihost.fxb in the PlugIn's directory now,
  if it has write permission there.


V1.30
=====

Release Date: 2007-04-05
Changes:
- Bank/program loading made more flexible; if the format of a loaded bank
  doesn't match the PlugIn settings, a Yes/No message box allows to override
  the abort (special for new Waldorf Wave 2.V).
- Plugins that try to set the host's speed (like Tap!) can do that now.
- Various internal changes & corrections.

V1.29
=====

Release Date: 2006-10-30
Changes:
- Entering registration data in daHornet did not work; corrected.
- Menus in Zebra 2 did not work; corrected.


V1.28
=====

Release Date: 2006-10-02
Changes:
- Stereo Input/Output ASIO Channel Selection corrected.
- Unused ASIO drivers should be released now.
- BPM changes can be directly entered on the main toolbar now.
- "Player Sync" setting finally provides a simple transport control
  (i.e. the hosts can now tell the plugins that they are playing at
   a certain position); makes it easier to run sequencer/tracker plugins
   in an orderly fashion.
- Finer-grained Priority selection.
- Wave Player files can be unloaded.


V1.27
=====

Release Date: 2006-06-12
Changes:
- When no Wave Input device is loaded, 2 channels of silence are used.
- I/O Remapping shows more meaningful device channel names.
- Wave Player had a problem if used without a Wave Input device; corrected.
- Wave Player has separate Autorepeat settings for playing and rewinding now.
- PC keyboard can be captured and sent to simulated MIDI keyboard now, even if
  this doesn't have the focus (or is hidden); can be toggled with F11.
- MIDI Panic button added.
- Stereo Input/Output ASIO Channel selection works again.

V1.26
=====

Release Date: 2006-05-08
Changes:
- Wave Player can now be inserted before or after the PlugIns; that means that
  you can send wave files through effects.
- Wave Player Auto-repeat introduced a little delay; corrected.
- Load / save file selection from PlugIns sometimes failed; corrected.
- Sending MIDI messages sometimes caused problems; corrected.

V1.25
=====

Release Date: 2006-02-06
Changes:
- VST SDK 2.4 support
  NB: while the programs should support all plugins written to the new
  specification, they do NOT call the 64-bit processDoubleReplacing() method,
  even if it's available.
  The reason is simply that the internal signal processing is done with
  32-bit floats; it would mean senseless conversions to and from 64-bit to
  cover the 64-bit functionality. VSTHost and SAVIHost are designed to run
  on older and slower machines, too, and I don't want to place heavy burdens
  on these by doubling all buffer sizes for a negligible improvement in sound
  quality.

V1.24
=====

Release Date: 2005-12-12
Changes:
- Shell Plug-ins support enhanced.

V1.23
=====

Release Date: 2005-10-13
Changes:
- Shell plug-ins can finally be loaded (i.e. the Waves plug-ins work).

V1.22
=====

Release Date: 2005-10-03
Changes:
- The sample rate can now be changed if the wave output device allows it.

V1.21
=====

Release Date: 2005-08-02
Changes:
- Improved Wave File Player/Recorder.
  They are separate entities now; i.e. you can playback one file and record
  its output, plus anything generated the Audio Input and/or loaded
  VSTis/effects to another file.
  It still follows a simple "tape recorder" paradigm and both player and
  recorder are inserted into the audio stream just before it is sent to the
  output device. Ping-pong recording is possible now.
- A "just for fun" feature - like on an analog tape recorder, you can listen
  to the audio data while it's rewinding or fast forwarding.
  The Winding audio level can be adjusted; at -60dB, the feature is turned off
  (saving some CPU cycles).

V1.20
=====

Release Date: 2005-07-19
Changes:
- Added a Wave File Player/Recorder.
  It can playback and record .WAV files in any bit rate up to 32 bit plus
  floating-point, with a configurable number of up to 32 channels.
  It follows a simple "tape recorder" paradigm and is simply inserted into
  the audio stream just before it is sent to the output device.

V1.19
=====

Release Date: 2005-04-29
Changes:
- SAVIHost can, in theory, load Shell plugins. This is untested.
- Added a version without keyboard; this saves another 50KB for
  plugins that either don't need a keyboard (effects) or come with
  one (instruments).

V1.18
=====

Release Date: 2005-03-29
Changes:
- In the Wave device configuration dialog, you can enter arbitrary buffer
  sizes between 16 and 11025 by hand.

V1.17
=====

Release Date: 2005-02-28
Changes:
- Extensive Reassign capabilities; you can define the input channels for
  each loaded effect that has inputs, the overall input channel assignment,
  and the overall output assignment.
- Additional command line flags:
    /noaudio - prevents loading of the Wave devices.
    /nomidi - prevents loading of the MIDI devices.
  These have been added since there are conditions where SAVIHost can die
  upon program start, such as:
    * Changed sound card, but the old ASIO driver is still there.
    * Ruined Windows MME configuration, where the default Wave Mapper can't
	  be opened or closed correctly.
  This allows SAVIHost to come up even if something in the current configuration
  is terribly defective. In previous versions, you had to clean the registry
  in such cases.
- The ASIO buffer size detection is much more robust and "intelligent" now.

V1.16
=====

Release Date: 2005-02-06
Changes:
- Bug fix: FL Studio 5 and Spectrasonics Atmosphere have been reported not to
  work with the previous versions - now they do.
- The effects' edit windows can finally be scrolled if their size is reduced;
  plus, there's a menu option that lets you turn off the automatic size
  adjustment, since some effects simply don't tell the truth when asked how
  big they want their edit area to be.
- Added a little level meter to the status bar; can be turned off from the menu.
- SAVIHost now remembers the position and size of the window between program
  invocations.

V1.15
=====

Release Date: 2005-01-29
Changes:
- Nasty bug fix - mono effects / synths could cause sudden death of the program
  (see http://forum.hermannseib.com/viewtopic.php?t=34 for details).
- Directly intertwined with that, mono output is now automatically converted to
  pseudo-stereo (i.e. simply output on both channels).

V1.14
=====

Release Date: 2005-01-18
Changes:
- Improved clipping behavior (previous versions created disastrous bzzzz sounds
  if the output level went over +1dB).
- Display of peak level in the status bar (updated every 750mS).

V1.13
=====

Release Date: 2004-12-17
Changes:
- Instead of the MIDI Channel Mask, a much more flexible MIDI Filter concept
  has been implemented (borrowed from Miditrix) that allows you to filter out
  practically any kind of MIDI message; can be separately set for each loaded
  Effect/VSTi.
- Fixed a bug that emerged upon MIDI Program Change message processing
  (see http://forum.hermannseib.com/viewtopic.php?t=27 for details).
- The BPM reported to the loaded effects can now be set and (de-)activated in
  both programs
  (see http://forum.hermannseib.com/viewtopic.php?t=24 for details).

V1.12
=====

Release Date: 2004-12-09
Changes:
- Use all available output channels now, if no stereo pair is selected.
- Can adjust the process priority.

V1.11
=====

Release Date: 2004-11-23
Changes:
- Added a workaround for bug in Reaktor 4 VSTi.
- Load/save of .fxp's now works for formatless chunks.

V1.10
=====

Release Date: 2004-11-18
Changes:
- Bug fix: Sample rates other than 44.1kHz are now supported (in previous
  versions, you could set them through the ASIO Driver's Control Panel, but
  they were not passed to the effects).
- Keyboard bar is now resizable / dockable.

V1.09
=====

Release Date: 2004-11-12
Changes:
- You can now load/save programs from/to .fxp files.
- MME Wave device support has been sped up quite a bit.
- You can set the BPM rate communicated to the loaded effect/VSTi.
- The approximate CPU percentage spent in buffer processing is shown in the
  status bar.

V1.08
=====

Release Date: 2004-10-26
Changes:
- you can now select the used ASIO channels. i.e. you're not limited to the
  first two channels any more. To select them, a new dialog has been added that
  can be called from the menu as "Devices / ASIO Channel Selection".

V1.07
=====

Release Date: 2004-10-22
Changes:
- A highly configurable keyboard bar has been added so that you can easily send
  MIDI messages to VSTis that don't offer a built-in keyboard. You can play on
  the simulated MIDI keyboard with the mouse or the PC keyboard.
  The Left Mouse Button acts like a finger; as long as you keep it pressed, the
  note is played.
  The Right Mouse Button acts as a "sticky finger"; if you press it over a note,
  this note keeps on playing until you release it by pressing the right mouse
  button over it once again.

V1.06
=====

Release Date: 2004-10-08
Changes:
- Improved MIDI handling.
- Improved MME Wave handling.
- Changes between MME and ASIO drivers work much better now.

V1.05
=====

Release Date: 2004-10-08

That's when SAVIHost was first mentioned on KvR - I didn't think about keeping
a version history before that, since I had just sent some copies to interested
persons upon personal request.

H.G.Fortune, BTW, should receive proper credits - it was his idea to provide a
stripped-down version of VSTHost for "instant standalone" creation.

How should I have known that I'd compile SAVIHost's history about 10 years
later...
... and SAVIHost still lives on :-)
